MyToken Smart Contract


Description


This Solidity smart contract defines a basic ERC20-like token called MyToken. It allows for minting (creating) and burning (destroying) tokens, while keeping track of balances for different addresses.

Features

Token Name: ester


Token Symbol: est


Total Supply: Initialized to 0 and can be increased through minting.


Minting: Allows adding tokens to the total supply and balances of specific addresses.


Burning: Allows subtracting tokens from the total supply and balances of specific addresses.


Prerequisites


Solidity 0.8.26 or compatible compiler


Ethereum development environment


Installation


To deploy and interact with the contract:


Contract Deployment


Deploy the contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network. Make sure to set appropriate gas fees and confirmations.

Interacting with the Contract
You can interact with the deployed contract using tools like Remix IDE, Truffle console, or by building a frontend application.

Example interaction with MyToken contract:

Mint Tokens:

solidity
Copy code
function mint(address _address, uint _val) public {
    // Function to mint `_val` tokens to `_address`
}
Burn Tokens:

solidity
Copy code
function burn(address _address, uint _val) public {
    // Function to burn `_val` tokens from `_address`
}
Testing
Write tests using frameworks like Truffle or Hardhat to ensure the contract functions as expected.
